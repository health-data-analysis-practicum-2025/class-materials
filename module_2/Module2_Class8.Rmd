## Looking ahead to your final projects


It is time to start thinking about your final projects, which will be the focus of the course after we wrap up Module 2. 


### Project structure

Your final project will have the following pieces:

* Question of interest
* Data set and design
  * Outcome variable
  * Predictor variable(s) of primary interest
  * Potential confounders
  * Potention effect modifiers
* Directed acyclic graph (DAG) showing the hypothesized relationships of interest and including potential confounders and effect modifiers
* A primary analysis to address the question of interest
* Communication of results in tables and figures

### Working project document

To help you get started, we have created a working Google Doc where you can record your plans. This will help you organize your thoughts, find classmates working on similar questions, and help us keep track of who is working on what.

Here is link to the [working doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14dz0CLhY9J6G-G-gQF8VPvg4xDIhZ4xWyHV9o1VQRW8/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}.

Feel free to start contributing your ideas; nothing here is set in stone, this is just a starting point that you will update in the coming weeks.


### Getting started

Shortly after we return from Spring Break, we will want you to have identified:

* A research question of interest in public health
* A data source you can use to answer this question

It will be helpful if you spend some time thinking about this now! 

**Note:** This is often an iterative process where you decide on a question, look for data, and then realize you need to refine or modify your question based on available data.

Here are some tips for **framing a research question in public health**:

* Start with a *general* area of public health in which you have interest; then narrow to a *specific* frame your question in terms of investigating a relationship between a specific outcome variable (like "disease status" from our Module 1) and one or more primary predictor variables ("smoking status" from our Module 1.)
* Later you will need to think about the possibility of effect modifiers and possible confounders, but for now just think about that primary relationship of interest.

Here are some tips for **locating data to answer this question**:

* If you have a specific area of interest in mind, you can Google for data in that area.
* Or explore the links below to see what type of data is available.
